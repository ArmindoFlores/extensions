                You can now submit your extension for verification. To start the verification process respond to your pull request with the message \`/verify <extension name>\` where \`<extension-name>\` is the key used in the `extensions.json` file in your pull request.

                Once this has been done a thread will be created on the [Owlbear Rodeo Discord](https://discord.gg/u5RYMkV98s) tracking the status of all the above guidelines.

                Once the community has verified that all the guidelines have been passed the Owlbear Rodeo team will add the verified badge to your extension.`
